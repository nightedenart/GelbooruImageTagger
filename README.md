# GelbooruImageTagger
Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) app that paints metadata properties to images downloaded from Gelbooru.

Currently, this app paints metadata such as any artists, copyrights / intellectual properties, keywords / tags and image source.

This makes images easier to search for a particular tag or author.

## Install instructions

You can either build the project from source using Visual Studio (Visual Studio 2022 recommended) or you can go to the 'Releases' and get the latest binary and run (easiest method).

## How to use

Typically, images downloaded from Gelbooru are in the form of an MD5 hash (e.g. 5f97439d98b85503c6419c2aa7521a01.jpg) or prefixed with "sample_" if it's a thumbnail.

Add the downloaded files to the list and click 'Tag' when ready.

You can also go into the settings to skip images that have already been tagged.

## Notes

This project and repository is not affiliated with nor endorsed by Gelbooru in any way. I made the project as a hobby and for personal use.
